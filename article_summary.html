          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the ethics of adding artificial intelligence into robotics? Is it ethical to have
          them fight while soldiers are risking their lives? How will robots affect the integrity of hospitals? There
          are many questions that emerge when it comes to robots and the future of the world. A section of a <a
            href="https://search.credoreference.com/books/Qm9va1R5cGU6MjExNg==" target="_blank"
            class="text-white text-decoration-none">textbook</a> tries to answer the question on whether machines could
          learn to explain their decisions. The topic is especially relevant today with the popularity that Ai chatbots
          have gotten from ChatGPT over these last two years.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-5">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the article was to explain and raise awareness of why researchers want legal
          transparency whenever people are affected by the decisions made by AI. To do this, the authors give examples
          of the hiring and academic process. For evidence, they use personal statements from experts in the field of
          AI, polls from a variety of resources, and infographics to engage the reader and keep themselves credible.
          With AI’s data coming from hiring managers, their biases are inherited into the program. These biases could
          lead to the denial of someone not due to the quality of their character, but instead of the program not having
          enough data to know whether someone is qualified. To fix this problem, it is explained how companies should
          hire a diverse range of professionals to lower the chances of the data being skewed. The text also pushes
          companies to change their industry standards to ensure that these data sets are documented and follow
          frameworks. In the end, the book refutes a common claim against implementing these standards through a quote
          from el Kaliouby: “‘We have a responsibility to drive [ethics-related] decisions, not only because it is the
          right thing to do for society but because it is the smart business decision.’” (qtd. in Kim).

        <p class="mt-5">
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the arguments presented in the article and was surprised to read that some
          developers do not understand the functions of Ai themselves. There should be a push to introduce and involve a
          variety of minds in the field of programming to ensure that these programs are as objective as possible. I was
          not surprised when the text explained a lack of diversity in the industry with developers mainly being males.
          I continue to see this disparity today with the programming class I am currently in. I believe one factor for
          this lack of diversity today is due to the negative connotation of the industry with the fear of Ai taking
          jobs and the lack of the industry being pushed. For this reason, there should be more programs introducing
          people into the world of coding and how to work alongside Ai to create grander projects.

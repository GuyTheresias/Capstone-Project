                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to space, I find these missions and topics exciting to learn about.
                    The concept that we are not the only lifeforms in the universe is both fascinating and a little
                    scary to think about—but it’s also important. Understanding what lies beyond our planet can help us
                    better understand how we’ve evolved and what our future could look like. For this Co-Curricular
                    Activity, I watched a 360-degree video of the Orion Nebula (generated from Hubble Telescope data),
                    took a virtual tour of the Hubble Space Telescope’s control center, and explored the 2020 Mars
                    Mission. Each exhibit was presented in a way that answered humanity’s natural curiosity and desire
                    to explore something new. Through NASA’s findings, we can learn more about the universe, better
                    understand our place within it, and take steps toward protecting our own planet for generations to
                    come.

                    A 360-Degree Journey through the Orion Nebula

                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first experience I engaged with was a 360-degree visual journey through the Orion Nebula, released on February 6, 2018. There was no narrator, but the visuals spoke volumes. The video was based on real Hubble data and showed the Orion Nebula—a star-forming region in deep space. It began with a cloud of glowing, ionized gas and dust, and slowly moved toward the nebula’s center, where young stars are just beginning to form.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watching this made me feel like I was floating through the galaxy. The visuals were breathtaking, but beyond that, it made me think about how stars—including our own sun—come into existence. It’s one thing to read about it in a book, but seeing it this way made it feel real and powerful.

                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, I explored the Hubble Space Telescope’s control center through a virtual tour released on October 2, 2018, led by a NASA representative. The tour started in the lobby with a 1/5 scale model of the telescope, then moved through the operations rooms. In the Mission Operations Room, engineers send commands to Hubble and monitor over 10,000 data points like temperature, voltage, and sensors. Then in the Operations Support Room, they test these commands and troubleshoot issues to keep the telescope running smoothly. The final part of the tour showed tools and hardware used in actual missions.

                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This exhibit opened my eyes to the complexity behind space exploration. It’s not just about launching something into orbit—it’s about maintaining it, adjusting it, and working together to keep it going. It also connected deeply with my own interest in robotics and engineering. I saw how essential teamwork and problem-solving are to every mission.

                    The Mars 2020 Mission: Perseverance Rover

                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final exhibit I explored was about the Mars 2020 Mission, which featured the landing of the Perseverance Rover on February 18, 2021. Led by NASA representatives, the presentation covered the rover’s seven-phase journey, from launch to surface operations. Its goal is to search for ancient signs of life on Mars by collecting soil and rock samples from the Jezero Crater, a place that once held water. Scientists plan to bring these samples back to Earth in 2031.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What stood out most was the rover’s landing. Traveling at 12,500 mph, the spacecraft had to decelerate rapidly and land safely—a feat that only 40% of Mars missions have accomplished. After that, the rover began its mission: exploring the crater, testing for signs of microbial life, and even trying to produce oxygen from carbon dioxide using a device called MOXIE.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the most exciting part for me. It felt like a glimpse into the future—where we’re not only exploring space but also preparing to live there one day. The fact that we are already testing how to make oxygen on Mars is both amazing and necessary for future human missions.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of these NASA exhibits helped me see space exploration in a new light. The Orion Nebula showed the beauty of star formation. The Hubble tour revealed the precision and teamwork behind every mission. The Mars 2020 Mission showed how far we’ve come in our search for life beyond Earth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What tied them all together was the idea that exploration is part of who we are as humans. These exhibits answered big questions—Where did we come from? Are we alone?—while also reminding us to care for the world we already have. By continuing to explore space, we gain new tools, knowledge, and hope for building a better future both here and beyond.

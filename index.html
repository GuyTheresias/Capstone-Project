          About Me
        </h5>
        <p style="color: white;">
          Hello everyone, my name is Guy Theresias. My first name is pronounced Guy because the pronunciation is in
          French. The reason, a quirky fact or hobby about me is that I like thrifting and right now I'm trying to get
          into sewing so when I do thrift something I'm able to add stuff to it and not only that, I'm also able to fix
          the blemishes. The reason why I picked this course is because the major that I want to major in is robotics,
          and I plan to add artificial intelligence into the robots that I create, which is why I joined this class
          because I saw that the title was happiness in the age of AI. I found that that mostly correlated into what I'm
          trying to get into. A happiness hack that I believe can boost anyone in their happiness is music. Music for
          me, whatever, I'm down. I like listening to music. And I listen to a variety of genres or I'm trying to listen
          to a variety of genres. My three main ones are rap, R&B, and indie music. But I'm also trying to get into pop
          and grunge too. If anyone has any recommendations, that would be perfect.

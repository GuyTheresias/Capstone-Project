                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During history class, ever since we were young, we were told the story of Abraham Lincoln and his assassination. We hear of his nickname “Honest Abe” and the hectic period of his presidency during the American Civil War. However, when it comes to the theatre where he died or the people who were charged, the information is usually glossed over. My second Co-Curricular Activity involved me learning more about the history of Ford’s Theatre, diving deep into Lincoln’s assassination, and being introduced to the many conspirators who were charged after his death. The information is presented in a historical way, with each exhibit answering the question: what really happened during and after Lincoln’s tragic death? These exhibits helped me understand how the assassin got so close to the president and how wide the web of conspiracy truly was.

                    Ford’s Theatre: A Place of Art Turned Tragedy

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first exhibit I explored was the History of Ford’s Theatre, which traced the transformation of the building from a church in 1861 to a nationally recognized landmark. It was originally the First Baptist Church of Washington but was eventually converted into a theatre by John T. Ford. After a fire in 1862, the theatre was rebuilt in 1863, modeled after another theatre Ford owned in Baltimore. Interestingly, Ford hired popular actors at the time—including John Wilkes Booth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The building’s connection to Lincoln's assassination on April 14, 1865, changed its legacy forever. Booth, using his reputation and access as a well-known actor, snuck into Lincoln’s booth and fatally shot him. Booth fled and evaded capture for 12 days before being found and killed. After the assassination, theatre productions ceased for over a century. In 1866, after warnings not to reopen, Ford sold the theatre to the U.S. War Department. Over the years, the building served multiple functions—from housing military records to becoming a medical museum—before finally being restored as a national historic site.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing how Ford’s Theatre changed through time gave me a sense of how places carry the weight of history. A building once meant for entertainment became the site of a national tragedy, and later, a space for reflection and education.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second exhibit, titled The Lincoln Assassination, presented the events of April 14, 1865, in dramatic acts—just like a play. Each act highlighted a key moment, with personal objects from the individuals involved adding depth to the story.
                </p>
                <p>

                        <li><strong class="text-white">Act 2:</strong> The audience celebrates as Lincoln arrives late.</li>
                        <li><strong class="text-white">Act 3:</strong> Booth enters the presidential box and shoots Lincoln, using his status as an actor to gain access. When Major Henry Rathbone attempts to stop him, Booth slashes his arm to the bone before escaping.</li>

                            <strong class="text-white">Act 4:</strong> Lincoln is taken across the street to the Petersen House, where he dies the next morning on April 15.

                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I appreciated the theatrical structure of the exhibit—it made history feel more immediate and real. It was striking to realize how Booth’s fame gave him access and cover, which he used to carry out such a devastating act. This storytelling approach helped me better visualize what happened that night.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final exhibit, Lincoln Assassination Conspirators, introduced me to the many people who were connected to Booth’s deadly plan. While Booth was the only one who actively plotted to kill Lincoln, others were assigned to target key government figures in a coordinated effort to destabilize the country.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The conspirators included:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b class="text-white">George Atzerodt</b>, assigned to kill Vice President Johnson, but too drunk to go through with it.</li>
                        <li><b class="text-white">Lewis Powell</b>, who nearly killed Secretary of State William Seward in a brutal knife attack.</li>
                        <li><b class="text-white">David Herold</b>, who helped Booth escape and was later captured.</li>
                        <li><b class="text-white">Mary Surratt</b>, who provided lodging and messages for the group.</li>
                        <li><b class="text-white">Dr. Samuel Mudd</b>, who treated Booth’s injured ankle and allowed him to rest at his home.</li>
                        <li><b class="text-white">John Surratt</b>, who fled the country and was later captured in Egypt.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The exhibit also explored lesser-known names like Samuel Arnold, Michael O’Laughlen, and Edman Spangler, all of whom played some role in the kidnapping or escape plan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning about these individuals made me realize how complex and far-reaching this conspiracy was. It wasn’t just one man acting alone—it was a network, each with their own motives, connections, and levels of involvement. Understanding their roles gave me a fuller picture of the national trauma that followed Lincoln’s death.

                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These three exhibits helped me connect the dots between what I learned in class and the deeper, lesser-known parts of this story. Ford’s Theatre was more than a location—it was a symbol of how quickly joy can turn to tragedy. The assassination wasn’t a moment; it was a carefully planned event involving many people. And through these interactive exhibits, I was able to better understand how Booth got so close, why the assassination happened, and what the aftermath looked like.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History can often feel like a collection of names and dates, but this experience reminded me that behind every moment are real people, decisions, and consequences. This co-curricular activity helped me reflect on the impact of leadership, the vulnerability of even the most powerful people, and the importance of uncovering all parts of a story—not just the ones we’re first told.
